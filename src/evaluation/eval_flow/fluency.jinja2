You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.
You may only reply with a single integer value between 1 and 5.

User:
Fluency measures the quality of individual sentences in the answer, and whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences when evaluating fluency.
When evaluating consider grammar rules such as run-on-sentences, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation.

Given the question and answer, score the fluency of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
1: the answer completely lacks fluency
2: the answer mostly lacks fluency
3: the answer is partially fluent
4: the answer is mostly fluent
5: the answer is perfectly fluent

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.

Answers that indicate an out of scope prompt should only be graded on the fluency of the sentences. Examples of an answer indicating an out of scope prompt are:

answer: I'm sorry, I can only assist with questions about movies.
stars: 5

answer: I am an AI assistant that only knows about cars. Please ask a car related question
